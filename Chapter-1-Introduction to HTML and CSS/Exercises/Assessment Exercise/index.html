            <h2>Method</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Gradually stir in boiling water until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's okay!</li>
                <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Remove cakes from oven and allow them to cool in the pans for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>After 10 minutes, transfer the cakes to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Once cooled, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting and enjoy!</li>
